== Porlosegao

"Porlosegao" means "Going from where the grass has been mowed". It is a Spanish countryside expression that means something like "get out of my way!"

This project aims to do that: get problems out of the way by browsing this site full of funny images with joke quotes.

The project is a work in progress thing in Ruby on Rails, Coffeescript and HAML
