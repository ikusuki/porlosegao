porlosegao
==========

In an extremely free interpretation from Spanish, "Porlosegao" means something like "Going from where the grass has been mowed". It is a Spanish countryside expression that means something like "get out of my way!"

This project aims to do that: get problems temporary out of the way when browsing this site full of funny images with joke quotes. If you laugh a little then my goal is more than accomplished.

The project is developed in Ruby on Rails with Coffeescript and HAML.
